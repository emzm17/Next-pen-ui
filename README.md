## Description
A web-based code compiler is an online tool that allows developers to write, compile, and execute code directly from a web browser without the need for installing any software or development environment on their local machines. These compilers support multiple programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and more, providing an accessible platform for coding, debugging, and testing.
